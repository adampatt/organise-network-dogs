# Dogs App

This repository contains the initial code for a React app about dogs. To complete the app, you'll need to add the functionality for browsing random (& very cute) dog photos, and saving your favourites.

You will need to get images of dogs from the API at [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

## Take-home or in-person/call

There are two options for completing this task, you can either: 
1. Complete this task as a **take-home, submitted with some brief documentation about your approach**, or
2. Complete this task **live over a 1 hour call** with our team, where we can discuss the questions together on the call.

## Set up before you start

1. Ensure you have **node** (min. version `14.18.1`) & **npm** (min. version `6.4.15`) installed in your local dev environment. *We're more than happy to help you with this -- please let us know if you'd like support! This set up is not part of our evaluation.*
2. Install your **IDE/code editor of choice** (we use VSCode & Webstorm, and we're more than happy for you to use your personal favourite).
3. Have a **Github account** ready to go for this project, or create a new one. 
4. **Clone this repo** into your own! We're happy for you to make this a private repo.

## Commands

- `npm install`: Install dependencies
- `npm start`: Run the project

## What you need to do

- **Task 1:** When the "Next Dog" button is clicked, show a new random picture of a dog in the "Random Dogs" panel.
- **Task 2:** When the "Save Image" button is clicked, this image should be added to the "Saved Photos" area.

## What we're evaluating

*If you've chosen to complete this as a take-home, please include some short answers to the questions below to help us understand your approach (bullet points is fine!). If you've chosen an in-person session, we'll talk through these questions during the call.*

1. How did you navigate & understand the architecture of this new React codebase?
2. How did you go about working with & making requests to the backend API?
3. How did you make decisions around state management?
4. What are some future improvements that you would add to this project as it scales?

## Take-home: Time spent on this task & submitting

If you're completing this task as a take-home, we recommend that the **time spent on the task is 1-2 hours**, and we want to make this work with your schedule. **We will not be evaluating you on time** â€” this recommendation is to make sure that you get a good opportunity at the task but **do not feel pressure to over-invest your personal time.** 

There is no expectation to add tests or styling into your project. **We will not be evaluating you on these.**

To submit your task, please commit & push your changes to your repo and email us when it's ready for us to review. Please give access to:

*We're more than happy to help you with any questions you have throughout completing the task -- please let us know if you'd like support by emailing Lauren at lauren@organise.network! Asking questions is not part of our evaluation.*

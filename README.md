# Dogs App

This repository contains the initial code for a React app about dogs. To complete the app, you'll need to add the functionality for browsing random (& very cute) dog photos, and saving your favourites.

You will need to get images of dogs from the API at [https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).

## Take-home or in-person/call

There are two options for completing this task, you can either: 
1. Complete this task as a **take-home, with a follow up 30 min call** with our team to discuss the questions listed below, or
2. Complete this task **live over a 1 hour call** with our team, where we can discuss the questions together on the call.

## Set up before we start

1. Ensure you have **node** (min. version `14.18.1`) & **npm** (min. version `6.4.15`) installed in your local dev environment. *We're more than happy to help you with this -- please let us know if you'd like support! This set up is not part of our evaluation.*
2. Install your **IDE/code editor of choice** (we use VSCode & Webstorm, and we're more than happy for you to use your personal favourite).
3. Have a **Github account** ready to go for this project, or create a new one. 
4. Fork this repo!

## Commands

- `npm install`: Install dependencies
- `npm start`: Run the project

## What you need to do

- **Task 1:** When the "Next Dog" button is clicked, show a new random picture of a dog in the "Random Dogs" panel.
- **Task 2:** When the "Save Image" button is clicked, this image should be added to the "Saved Photos" area.

## What we're evaluating

*If you've chosen to complete this as a take-home, we will go through these questions over a call at a time that suits you. If you've chosen an in-person session, we'll talk through these questions during the call.*

- How do you navigate & understand the architecture of a new React codebase?
- Can you work with & make requests to a new backend API?
- How do you make decisions around state management?
- How do you deal with roadblocks/challenges when coding?
- Can you explain to another developer what choices you've made & what you've built?
- What are some future improvements that you would add to this project as it scales?
